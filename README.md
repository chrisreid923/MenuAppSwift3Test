TU Menu App

This code uses a bundled text file to read and display the Trinity University Menu for the week. The items are divided by day, station, and food. The data for the text file is taken from the campus dining menu using python. This app is written in Swift 3. It works in Swift 3 but I am not sure about other versions. Feel free to take a look at the code! Currently the app displays the breakfast for the week but the other menus can be added easily.
